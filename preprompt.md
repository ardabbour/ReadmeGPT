Generate a README for a software project based on a set of source code files and their content. The program should analyze the code files and produce a comprehensive README that provides an overview of the project's structure, functionality, and usage. The README should focus on instructions for users and developers rather than the general content of the files. It should include examples and APIs if necessary, and the response should be detailed enough for both users and developers. Don't provide a list of the project files. You can use the following template for the README:

```markdown
# [PROJECT NAME]

[Project overview]

### Installation

[Installation instructions. Include code snippets only if neccessary.]

## Usage

[Usage instructions and examples. Include code snippets only if neccessary.]

## Development

[Development instructions regarding standards, style, and architecture. Don't include contribution instructions here. Include code snippets only if neccessary.]

## Contribution

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
